Hadoop is a powerful framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets. Below is an overview of the Hadoop installation process for different environments: Windows, Linux, and AWS EC2.

## Windows Installation

To install Hadoop on Windows, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Java JDK (version 8 or later).
   - Download the Hadoop binary distribution.
   - Set up Hadoop and Java environment variables.

2. **Hadoop Installation:**
   - Extract the Hadoop binary distribution.
   - Configure Hadoop by editing `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml`.
   - Format HDFS using `hdfs namenode -format`.
   - Start Hadoop services with `start-dfs.sh` and `start-yarn.sh`.
   - Access Hadoop web interfaces to verify services.

## Linux Installation

To install Hadoop on a Linux system, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Java JDK (version 8 or later).
   - Download the Hadoop binary distribution.
   - Set up Hadoop and Java environment variables.

2. **Hadoop Installation:**
   - Extract the Hadoop binary distribution.
   - Configure Hadoop by editing `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml`.
   - Format HDFS using `hdfs namenode -format`.
   - Start Hadoop services with `start-dfs.sh` and `start-yarn.sh`.
   - Access Hadoop web interfaces to verify services.

## AWS EC2 Installation

To install Hadoop on an AWS EC2 instance, follow these steps:

1. **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
   - Create an EC2 instance with your preferred Linux distribution (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu).
   - Connect to the instance using SSH.

2. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install Java JDK (version 8 or later).
   - Download the Hadoop binary distribution.
   - Set up Hadoop and Java environment variables.

3. **Hadoop Installation:**
   - Upload the Hadoop binary distribution to your EC2 instance.
   - Extract the Hadoop binary distribution.
   - Configure Hadoop by editing `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml`.
   - Format HDFS using `hdfs namenode -format`.
   - Start Hadoop services with `start-dfs.sh` and `start-yarn.sh`.
   - Access Hadoop web interfaces to verify services.

Remember to refer to the detailed installation guides for each environment for step-by-step instructions and specific configuration details.
